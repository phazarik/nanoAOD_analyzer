# nanoAODv9_analyzer

These codes are compatible with nanoAOD version 9 (used in UL2016 dataset). These codes are curently designed to read into nanoAOD files, create an array of reconstructed muons and plot the invariant mass of the leading muons in each event.

#### How to run the analysis code :
- The input files are stored in the directory ``.....nanoAODv9_analyzer/AnalysisCodes/inputs``
- The analysis codes are stored in the directory ``.....nanoAODv9_analyzer/AnalysisCodes/``
- Open root prompt in this ``AnalysisCodes`` directory and load the code like this :
```
[] .L nano9Ana.C+
```
This compiles the C code and makes it executable.
Once loading is complete, execute the following.
```
[] .x ana.C(1)
```
- The argument inside ``ana.C()`` stands for the different input files.
- The location to the input files should be given in the ``ana.C`` file before this step.
- This step generates a ``hst_<process name>.root`` file and a ``sum_<process name>.txt`` file in their respective irectories.

#### Making overlays

After the ``hst_<process name>.root`` files are generated by the analysis code, an overlay of some plot inside these files can be made as follows.
- Go to the directory ``.....nanoAODv9_analyzer/Overlay/``
- Put the name of the input files and required the plot in ``overlay.C``
- Run the following inside the root prompt.
```
[] .x overlay.C
```
